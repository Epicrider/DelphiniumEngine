# DelphiniumEngine

This is an Engine being developed on the side following The Cherno's tutorials on OpenGL.
This will be a testing ground for my exploration of Game Engines and GPUS and Graphics Frameworks.
This engine or what is associated with it may turn to be utilized in a true game engine for game development.
